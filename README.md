# eth-ctf-challenge
I created this Ethereum challenge for a CTF

# Getting started
Check out truffle (ethereum development environment and testing framework) + ganache (quickneasy eth client), set them up
Then look at Challenge.sol and try to understand what needs to be done
See SolveCTF.js for the solution, which can be placed in truffle's test folder and executed using $ truffle test
